    <p> Hello! My name is Hanna Kang, and I am 22 years old. I graduated from Cornell University in 
        May 2022, majoring in both Information Science and English. Within those two majors, I've 
        concentrated on UX design and creative writing respectively, and I love being able to express
        myself artistically through my combined technological and literary backgrounds. 
         <br/> <br/>
        Please take a look at my resume and portfolio for a better idea of my UX design and writing
        background! 
    </p>
